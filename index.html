      <section>
        <p>
          I've been designing since high school. I have a strong eye for it, but
          design is only a part of my end goal. I also have an aptitude for
          coding, and I've been honing in this combination of skillsets to
          become an excellent front-end developer.

          <h3>First Encounter</h3>
          <p>
            My first bit of exposure to the tech industry was with OpptIn, a
            startup company. I landed a UX/UI design internship and delved deep
            into user personas and pain points and learned to fight for the end
            user.

          <h3>Wielding Mjolnir</h3>
          <p>
            I dive into The Odin Project, an open-source bootcamp of sorts,
            which organizes a path to the web development profession through
            free online resources and an active online community.
