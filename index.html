        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          I've been designing since high school, but it's only part of what I
          can do. I also have a strong aptitude for coding, and I've been honing
          this combination of skillsets to become a pixel-perfect
          <strong>front-end developer</strong>.

          <h3>First Encounter</h3>
          <p>
            My first bit of exposure to the tech industry was with OpptIn, a
            startup company. I landed a UX/UI design internship and delved deep
            into user personas and pain points and learned to fight for the end
            user.

          <h3>Wielding Mjolnir</h3>
          <p>
            I dove headfirst into The Odin Project, an open-source bootcamp of
            sorts, which organizes a path to the web development profession from
            ground zero through free online resources and an active online
            community.

          <h3>Design 101</h3>
          <p>
            I took a graphic design internship with Faith Assembly of God and
            learned how to produce deliverables as a service. I also took
            courses that taught me the craftsmanship and science of design and
            layout composition.
