      <section>
        <p>
          I've been designing since high school. I have a strong eye for it, but
          design is only a part of my end goal. I also have an aptitude for
          coding, and I've been honing in this combination of skillsets to
          become a pixel-perfect front-end developer.

            <h3>First Encounter</h3>
            <p>
              My first bit of exposure to the tech industry was with OpptIn, a
              startup company. I landed a UX/UI design internship and delved deep
              into user personas and pain points and learned to fight for the end
              user.

              I dived into The Odin Project, an open-source bootcamp of sorts,
              which organizes a path to the web development profession through
              free online resources and an active online community.

              I take a graphic design internship with Faith Assembly of God and
              hone the craftsmanship of composition.
