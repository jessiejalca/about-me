        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          I've been designing since high school, but it's only part of what I
          can do. I also found a strong passion for coding, and I've been honing
          this combination of skillsets to become a pixel-perfect
          <strong>front-end developer</strong>.

          <h3>A Whole New World</h3>
          <p>
            My first bit of exposure to the tech industry was with OpptIn, a
            startup company. I landed a UX/UI design internship and delved deep
            into user personas and pain points and learned to fight for the end
            user.

          <h3>Wielding Mjolnir</h3>
          <p>
            I dove headfirst into
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank"
              >The Odin Project</a
            >, an open-source bootcamp of sorts, which organizes and bridges
            free online resources into a path to web development as a profession
            from ground zero. Here, I got to connect with a community of
            developers and started to understand the power of coding.

          <h3>Design 101</h3>
          <p>
            I took courses that taught me the craftsmanship and science of
            design and layout composition. I also took a graphic design
            internship with a megachurch. I learned how to communicate with
            different departments of an organization and present deliverables as
            a service.

          <h3>Bridging the Gap</h3>
          <p>
            Beginning web design courses at UCF, I focused much more on web
            development, learned good practice, and produced more code than ever
            before. The semester was all about connecting the dots between
            coding and designing for a solid front-end foundation.

          <h3>Winter Wonderland</h3>
          <p>
            To take advantage of winter break, I'm learning TypeScript and
            React. I'm excited to speed up my process and clean up my code with
            these popular industry tools.
