# About Me

**_UCF DIG 3174: Front-End Web Design, Major Assignment Three_**

The final project for my Front-End Design course at UCF, this is a single-page, responsive website created with HTML and Sass processed into CSS.

It shares a little bit about me and describes some of my journey into coding and shows off what I've learned so far in the class. It's like an "About Me" page in a portfolio.
